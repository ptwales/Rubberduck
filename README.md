Rubberduck is a COM Add-In for the VBA IDE that makes VBA development even more enjoyable. 

##Features:
###Unit testing

Fully integrated unit testing with minimal (read: next to none) boiler plate code. Just add a reference to Rubberduck and create a new module scoped `Assert` class and you're ready to start writing tests. 

    '@TestModule
    Private Assert As New Rubberduck.AssertClass
    
    
    '@TestMethod
    Public Sub OnePlusOneIsTwo()
        Const expected As Long = 2
        
        Assert.AreEqual expected, Add(1, 1)
    End Sub

Rubberduck will find the Module and Procedure attributes and display your test methods for you in the Test Explorer.

###To-do items

Ever wish you had a task list built into the VBA IDE? You don't have to wish anymore. It's here. Rubberduck searches your code for `TODO:` comments and displays them all in one convenient location. Double-click on an item in the Todo List and jump to that location in the code.

The comments are also configurable, so you can decide what comments to add to your Todo List and what Priority level they should be.

###Code Explorer

Get a bird's eye view of your project and navigate anywhere, with the Code Explorer.
